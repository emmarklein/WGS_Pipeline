# Import chrM warning: If you want to study chromosome M, note that if there are reads in the first 0-50 nucleotides those are not displayed,
# and the last 50 nucleotides of reads are also not displayed. This is due to problems with visual cutoffs and chromosome lengths.
# If you need coverage in these regions, please adjust the script accordingly.

# Parameters:
#1. Bed12 file
#2. chrNameLength.txt file generated in the genome build step of STAR
#3. Header for output files to be displayed in genome browser
#4. Color of the wiggle track
#5. Whether to log10 normalize the data: y for log10 n for no normalization
#6. Bin size for the wiggle track
#7. Number of reads in the dataset (per wiggle track) for RPM standardization. If you don't wish to standardize by RPM, put the value 1 here.

# ex: python3 make_wiggle_tracks.py <bed12> <chrNameLength.txt> test-output blue n 50 1
