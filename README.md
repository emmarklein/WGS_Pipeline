# WGS pipeline

Excited to work with WGS data? 

This repository includes everything you need for genome mapping. Raw FASTQ files serve as input and undergo genome alignment to a reference. We will go through this process step by step using the T2T and hg38 references.

## SRA download and splitting
Letâ€™s start with raw FASTQ files (.fastq). FASTQ files contain our sequencing information. We can download Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra. This site stores raw sequencing data and alignment information. I will be using SRR8615934 as example data!

```
module load sratoolkit
prefetch --max-size 1000000000000 --force all -q SRR8670768
```
